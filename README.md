# Bank-Management-System-OOP-C-


• Binary File Persistence: Account data is stored/retrieved via binary file operations (fstream), enabling persistent storage and efficient record management.

• Input Validation & Constraints: Enforced 12-digit account numbers, valid account types (S/C), and balance limits (min/max) to ensure data integrity.

• Console UI Enhancements: Utilized system("color") and system("cls") for a polished, navigable menu-driven interface.

• Atomic Account Operations: Implemented deposit/withdraw logic with balance checks and file seeks, plus temp-file-based deletion for data consistency.
